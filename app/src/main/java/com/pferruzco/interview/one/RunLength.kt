/*
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data
elements) are replaced by just one data value and count.

For example we can represent the original 16 characters with only 9.
"AABCCCDEEEEAAAAA"  ->  "2AB3CD4E5A"

RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data,
which makes it a lossless data compression.
